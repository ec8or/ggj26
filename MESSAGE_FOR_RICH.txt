Morning Rich! 🎮

You're the Unity saviour - 5.5 hours to make this LEGENDARY! Game is fully functional, now we're adding the juice and clarity that'll blow everyone away on the big screen.

🎯 YOU CAN START NOW (no blockers):
✅ Layout/Scene org - Use those notes (Grid for Snap, crowd overlap for Sprint, scattered for Reaction/Timing)
✅ Title screens - Show round name + instructions before each round type ("SNAP ROUND - Tap when you see your mask!")
✅ Final Round - Last ~5 players, reaction showdown, crown the winner
✅ Chaos Card - Randomize everyone's masks before Advanced Snap (drama!)

🔧 Test with: `node test-bot.js 40 http://localhost:3000 5` (in /server)
   40 bots, 5 taps/sec - perfect for layout testing!

⏳ WAITING ON DISA (she's making these now):
🚦 Stop lights for Timing Round (red/yellow/green - you'll wire these into PrecisionRound.cs)
✅❌ Pass/Fail overlays (green tick, red X - show on masks after each round)

Once she delivers, drop them in Resources and wire them up. Then we playtest the HELL out of it with 40 bots and tune the balance.

The core game works. Now make it FEEL incredible. Animations, polish, that Unity magic only you can do.

Let's goooooo! 🚀👑
